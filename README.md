# butlersilver.com
Custom website for butlersilver.com.
## Overview
This website required a high level of design customization, without the need for a heavy CMS. A simple flask app with a lightweight, custom CSS gave the needed design flexibility, and the use of Google App Engine to manage deployments and back end infrastructure allowed for easy content updates.
## TODO:
1. Add caching to the Instagram feed to allow for better page load times
2. Integrate SQLAlchemy to store flat files in SQLite db
