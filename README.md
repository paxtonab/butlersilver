Custom flask app for butlersilver.com
## Overview
This project required a high level of design customization without the need for a heavier CMS, so I built a small flask app to support a fully customized design while allowing for basic content updates without requiring a heavy CMS.
## TODO:
1. Create instagram function to pull new Instagram posts on a semi-regular basis
2. Integrate SQLAlchemy to store flat files in SQLite db
